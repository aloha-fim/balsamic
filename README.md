```

## Installation

To run the backend, navigate to the backend folder and install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the frontend, navigate to the frontend folder and install the necessary dependencies using yarn:

```bash
yarn create vite # framework React and variant Typescript
cd frontend-react
yarn add axios # API routing
yarn build # for production
yarn dev # to run on localhost http://localhost:5173/
```

```bash
cd frontend-react
yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer # install tailwindcss in Reactnpx
tailwindcss init -p

#then change content in tailwind.config.js
content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],

#then copy css configs in index.css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

yarn build
yarn dev # to run on localhost http://localhost:5173/
```

Then, you can start the server by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt from within the `backend` directory:


## Usage
